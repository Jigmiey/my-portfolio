        <p>
            Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m Jigme Tseringâ€”a tech enthusiast with a passion for robotics, machine learning, and data analytics. While I currently work as
             a sales associate at Uniqlo, my background lies in developing innovative solutions in robotics and AI.
        </p>
        <p>
            From designing controllers for autonomous vehicles to building neural networks that merge 2D and 3D data for advanced object detection, 
            Iâ€™ve always enjoyed tackling challenges at the intersection of technology and creativity. My projects 
            focus on making machines smarter and finding practical solutions to real-world problems.
        </p>
        <p> 
            When Iâ€™m not working on tech, I enjoy photography, following FC Barcelona, and exploring new ways to 
            combine creativity with engineering. If this resonates with you, 
            letâ€™s connectâ€”Iâ€™m always up for meaningful conversations about the future of technology.

            </a>
            <p>This project focused on improving 3D object detection by combining camera images and LiDAR point clouds. Extensive testing was conducted using detectors like Cascade RCNN and Voxel-RCNN on the KITTI dataset.</p>

                <h3>Sentiment Analysis of Social Media Posts on Russia-Ukraine War</h3>
            </a>
            <p>This project focuses on analyzing public sentiment toward Ukraine in the context of the ongoing 
                Russia-Ukraine war using social media posts. By scraping tweets with relevant hashtags such as 
                #UkraineWar and #RussiaWar, the data is cleaned and processed to prepare it for sentiment 
                analysis. Several machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, 
                SVM, Random Forest, and XGBoost, are used to classify the sentiment of the tweets, with 
                pretrained models like AWS and Bard also applied to enhance accuracy. The majority prediction 
                from all models is taken as the final sentiment classification.
            </p>
            <p>The analysis goes beyond just classification by identifying key factors, reasons, and topics 
                that influence the sentiment toward Ukraine. Visualizations, including word clouds and charts,
                 illustrate public sentiment toward both Ukraine and Russia. Based on these insights, 
                 the project offers recommendations to improve Ukraine's international presence and image, 
                 potentially helping shape global perceptions during this critical time.
